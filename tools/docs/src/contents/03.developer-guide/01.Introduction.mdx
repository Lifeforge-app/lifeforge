###### Introduction

# Everything Behind LifeForge

If you have made you decision to have a slightly deeper look at this section, I have a pretty decent confident that you already have some level of knowledges on web development. So yeah! Welcome to the developer guide, where I'll try my very best to explain the underlying mechanism of huge monorepo, and explain everything as thoroughly as possible.

## Before We Start

Before embarking on the journey, there is something you have to take note of: **this project is still in a very unstable stage, and every single line of code you see in the repo might be subjected to changes in the very near future.**

The main motivation of me creating this project is never about creating something I can profit from, but rather to learn and grow as a developer, and something I can be proud of. It is a project that combines everything I have learnt throughout by journey in full-stack web development, and I hope that you can also learn something from it, and hopefully contribute to the project in the future.

Therefore, stability is not guaranteed, and you should be prepared for potential breaking changes as the project evolves, since I may refactor or rewrite large parts of the codebase as I learn and discover better approaches.

## Target audience

This guide is intended for developers who have decent experience with web development concepts and are familiar with modern JavaScript frameworks, particularly React. Whether you are fresh out of a bootcamp or have been working in the industry for a while, you should be able to find this guide resourceful.

For those who want to really dive deep into the codebase, here are some topics that will be beneficial to understand:

- <div className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:typescript" />
    **Advanced-level Typescript**
  </div>
  Familiarity with advanced TypeScript features such as generics, decorators,
  and type inference will help you understand the type inference system used
  throughout the codebase.
- <div className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="tabler:files" />
    **Monorepo**
  </div>
  Understanding the concepts of monorepos, including package management and
  workspace organization, so you won't get lost in the project structure.
- <div className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:react" />
    **React**
  </div>
  A solid understanding of React concepts, including hooks, context, and
  component lifecycle, is essential for navigating the codebase effectively.
- <div className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:express" />
    **ExpressJS**
  </div>
  The entire backend is built using ExpressJS. While handy wrappers are
  provided, it is still important to understand the underlying principles and
  patterns used in the framework.
- <div className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:tailwindcss" />
    **TailwindCSS**
  </div>
  Most of the modern web applications are built using TailwindCSS, so is
  LifeForge. Familiarity with its utility-first classes and stuff are really
  important.
- <div className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:storybook" />
    **Storybook**
  </div>
  Understanding how to use Storybook for developing and testing UI components in
  isolation will be beneficial for working with the component library.
- <div className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:pocketbase" />
    **Pocketbase**
  </div>
  Familiarity with Pocketbase will be helpful for understanding the backend
  integration and data management aspects of the project.

And the above basically covers all the tech stack used in LifeForge. If you are not familiar with any of these topics, I highly recommend you to take some time to learn them before diving into the codebase.

With that being said, this guide is not suitable for:

- Complete beginners in web development
- Developers unfamiliar with modern JavaScript frameworks
- Those who are not willing to learn and adapt to new technologies
- Those who do not care about code quality and best practices
