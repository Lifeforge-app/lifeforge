Before you begin, let's take a look at some background story of this project.

<Alert className="mt-6" type="tips">

Before becoming so popular today, LifeForge started as just a little personal project of mine back in late 2023.

This page mostly contains the stories behind the creation of LifeForge. If you are not interested and just want to get started, feel free to skip to the next page.

## The Back Story

Back in 2023, towards the end of the year, when I was still sinking into my pool of unfinished little projects, life was... okay, to say the least. But my portfolio, even though it contains dozens of projects, still looks pretty naive as most of the projects being showcased are small to medium sized, and a lot of them doesn't actually serve a real purpose. I hadn't let go of the idea of creating a large project that actually solves a real life problem since then... until that day.

It was just a normal day, lying on my bed after dinner, scrolling through YouTube shorts. It wasn't until I stumbled across a short film showing a scene of a pilot in the cockpit of a commercial airliner that I was taken aback. I was absolutely amazed at the complexity of the cockpit and the fact that the entire plane is controlled by all these buttons and switches in the cockpit. In a split second, I had an idea: what if I created a system that helped me take control of my life, just like the cockpit controls the airplane?

And the rest was history. I started a new project and started spamming code like crazy. Without me realizing it, this project was pushed into production and is now mostly functional and used by myself to manage various aspects of my life.

## Help and Support from Friends

I have to admit that I couldn't have made it this far without the help and support from my friends. Shoutout to <GithubUser username="lukashow" /> and <GithubUser username="jiahuiiiii" />. They are friends of mine for years that I've met back in high school. They have been accompanying me throughout the journey of my programming life.

As I was grinding hard on the LifeForge, they are the ones I can meet with face-to-face for real-time discussions. They are the one behind a lot of the ideas and suggestions that I have implemented in the system. They are also the ones who actually helped me test the system, create modules themselves, and provide feedbacks to improve the user experience.

Huge thanks to both of them for their continuous support and help throughout the journey of LifeForge. Couldn't have done it without you guys! 🔥

## The Best Christmas Gift

In the Christmas Eve of the year 2025, I woke up early in the morning, checked my phone, and was surprised with an email notification from GitHub saying that someone had opened a pull request to contribute a Russian translation for the LifeForge project. I was overjoyed. However, my excitement reached a new high when I saw that the repository had suddenly surged past 300 stars. It was a surreal moment for me, as I never expected that my little project would gain such recognition and appreciation from the community.

And the momentum didn't stop there. The star count kept climbing, and soon enough, the repository had surpassed 500 stars. It was a testament to the hard work and dedication that I had put into the project, and it was incredibly rewarding to see that others were finding value in it as well.

With the unprecedented motivation gained from the community, I pushed myself even harder to improve the system. Weeks after weeks were spent re-engineering the core architecture of the system to finally achieve true modularity.

The stars kept coming in, and my curious mind kept wondering: there must be someone out there who helps to promote this project, right? After some investigation, it turned out that there were mainly two sources of traffic: one from Zhihu, a popular Chinese Q&A website similar to Quora, and the other from X (formerly known as Twitter). Reading their posts and comments, it was amazing to see how the project had gained traction in different parts of the world, and it was a humbling experience to see how my work had resonated with people from different cultures and backgrounds.

Just when I was thinking that the peak had been reached, one day I was told by my friend <GithubUser username="jiahuiiiii" /> that the repository's star count suddenly skyrocketed past 1000 stars. It was an absolute WTF moment for me, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of craziness. It was like a dream come true, could have never thought that my humble project would gain such massive recognition and appreciation from the community.

However, with great recognition comes great responsibility. Dozens of issues and feature requests started pouring in. Working on school stuff as well as client's projects, I found myself in an extremely busy year of 2026. It was tired for sure, but the satisfaction of seeing the project grow and improve kept me going. Time to create a time management module for LifeForge, I guess? 👀

<section id="the-future">
## The Future

Heading into the third year of the project, LifeForge is still being actively worked on. From conception to actual realization, I was mostly on my own the whole time for the past two years. These hard works have finally paid off, with the system being used by hundreds of users worldwide.

A good beginning is half done. Now that half is done, i.e. the basis of the system, it is time for the system to become bigger. As the saying goes: many hands make light work. What one can achieve is always limited. If you are reading this documentation and are a web developer, I call on you to contribute to this project. Let us make the system the next Notion, but better!

<section id="why-life-forge">
## Why LifeForge?

Did I just mention Notion? The absolute GOAT for personal management? Why should you choose LifeForge instead of Notion? Notion is good, but it has its downsides. Primarily:

- **Open Source vs Closed Source**: First, unlike the completely open sourced LifeForge, it's a closed sourced program, which means you have absolutely no idea what it's doing with your data.
- **Data Control**: With Notion, your data is stored on their servers. You have no control over your data. If they decide to shut down their service, you lose everything. With LifeForge, you can self-host it on your own server or even on your local machine. You have complete control over your data.
- **Too Bloated**: Notion is a very powerful tool, but it is also very bloated. It has a lot of features that you may never use. This can make the user experience overwhelming and confusing. LifeForge, on the other hand, you can choose to install only the modules you need.
- **Paywall**: Notion has a paywall for many of its features. If you want to use the full potential of Notion, you have to pay for it. With LifeForge, you get all the features for free.

Speaking of closed sourced programs, a lot of the downsides mentioned above also apply to other software. With the trend of software becoming more and more subscription-based, people are starting to realize the importance of actually owning their software and data. LifeForge is here to provide an alternative for those who value freedom and control over their digital lives.

  #### Disclaimer

  All of the comparisons made above are purely my personal opinions based on my own experiences and research. They are not meant to discredit or undermine the value of any other software or service. Different people have different needs and preferences, and what works for one person may not work for another. I encourage you to do your own research and make your own decisions based on your own needs and preferences.

## However...

I can't promise you when LifeForge will be fully stable. There are still many features that are not yet implemented, and there may be bugs and issues that need to be fixed. If you decide to use LifeForge, please be aware of this and be prepared to encounter some issues along the way. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated to help improve the system.

Also, despite my best efforts to make the system as intuitive as possible, LifeForge being an open sourced self-hosted system means that it may require a little bit of technical knowledge to set up and maintain, unlike those closed sourced SaaS solutions where you can simply sign up and start using it right away. But don't worry, Docker is there to ease the process significantly, and the documentation is here to assist you. Feel free to take a look at the [Setup Guide](/getting-started/installation), and you will notice that it's not as hard as you think!

If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out for help by either opening an issue on GitHub or by emailing me personally at melvinchia623600@gmail.com. I'll respond as soon as I can (usually will be really quick since I'm currently a university student with not much workload and plenty of free time).
