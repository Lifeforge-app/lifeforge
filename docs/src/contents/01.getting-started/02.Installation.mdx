###### Installation

# Getting Started with LifeForge.

Back in the day, LifeForge used to be a collection of multiple repositories, where the frontend and backend are separated into different repositories. This made it hard for new users and developers to get started with the project, as they had to clone multiple repositories and set up the environment for each of them. To solve this problem, I decided to merge all the repositories into a single monorepo. This way, people only need to clone a single repository and set up the environment once.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following items on hand:

- <div>
    <span className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 mr-2 -translate-y-0.5 inline-flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:raspberrypi" className='translate-y-1' />
    **A Raspberry Pi or any other computer in Unix-based systems:**
    </span> 
    <span>This is the hardware that will be used to host the LifeForge API and database. You can use a Raspberry Pi, a virtual private server (VPS), or any other computer that uses Linux or MacOS.</span>
  </div>

- <div>
    <span className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 mr-2 -translate-y-0.5 inline-flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:nodedotjs" className='translate-y-1' />
    **Node.js (at least LTS)**
    </span> 
    <span>**and**</span>
    <span className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 mx-2 -translate-y-0.5 inline-flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:bun" className='translate-y-1' />
    </span>
    <span className='mr-2'>**Bun:**</span>
    <span>LifeForge is a pure TypeScript project, while the cute little bun, is used as the runtime environment. You can download and install bun from [here](https://bun.sh/).</span>
  </div>

- <div>
    <span className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 mr-2 -translate-y-0.5 inline-flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="simple-icons:pocketbase" className='translate-y-1' />
    **PocketBase:** 
    </span> 
    <span>This is the database that will be used to store all your data. You can download the latest version of PocketBase from [here](https://pocketbase.io/).</span>
  </div>

- <div>
    <span className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 mr-2 -translate-y-0.5 inline-flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="tabler:brain" className='translate-y-1' />
    **A functional brain:**
    </span> 
    <span>You will need to have a basic understanding of how to use a terminal and how to run a Node.js application.</span>
  </div>

- <div>
    <span className="text-bg-800 dark:text-bg-100 mr-2 -translate-y-0.5 inline-flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon icon="tabler:coffee" className='translate-y-1' />
    **A cup of coffee or tea:**
    </span> 
    <span>This is optional, but it's always nice to have a cup of coffee by your side when you're coding.</span>
  </div>

<Warning>
### Please Don't Use Windows

According to [this site](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/linux-statistics.html#Linux_Usage_Statistics), as of 2024, 

> A staggering 96.3% of the top one million web servers run on Linux, indicating its dominance in the internet infrastructure.

LifeForge is not an exception. It's been developed and tested primarily on Unix-like systems. Using the system on Windows will be alright, since it's just a web application after all, but when it comes to hosting the backend server and database, things might get tricky.

Therefore, if you're using Windows to host the LifeForge system, you might run into some issues. A Unix-like system such as Linux or macOS is strongly recommended to host the system. If you're using Windows, you can set up a virtual machine running Linux or use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

If you ever submit an issue regarding installation or deployment on Windows, please understand that I might simply mark it as "won't fix" since I don't have a Windows machine to test and debug the issues.

<section id="system-installation">
## System Installation

First, clone the LifeForge monorepo to your local machine or your server. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

<Code language="bash">
{'git clone https://github.com/lifeforge-app/lifeforge.git'}
</Code>

Then, install the dependencies by running the following command:

<Code language="bash">
{'cd lifeforge && bun install'}
</Code>

That's pretty much it for the installation of the system itself. Now, let's move on to the installation of the database.

</section>

<section id="database-installation">
## Database Installation

You'll need to set up a PocketBase database. For your information, PocketBase is a free, open-source, and self-hosted lightweight database. Head over to the [PocketBase website](https://pocketbase.io) and download the latest version of the database. Make sure to select the correct version for your server's operating system. Once downloaded, extract the files and inside the extracted folder, you'll find an executable file named **"pocketbase"**. Move this file to the **"database"** directory in the root of the LifeForge project.

<Note>
If you want to host the database in a different location, feel free to do so, but make sure to update the database path accordingly in the configuration file later.
</Note>

And that's it! You're all set for the installation process. But before you can fire up the LifeForge system, you'll need to configure it. Let's move on to the next section to learn how to do that.
