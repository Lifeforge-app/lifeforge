## Login Screen

When you open LifeForge, the very first thing you'll see is the login screen. Unlike those public services, LifeForge frontend UI doesn't have a registration form. The only account you can use to log in is the account you've created in the database dashboard.

Once logged in successfully, you'll be redirected to the dashboard, where you journey with LifeForge begins.

<Note>
  If you have OAuth2 providers set up in the database, there will be a button
  for each provider below the login button for you to log in with.

## Dashboard

When logged in, every time you fire up LifeForge, you'll be greeted with the dashboard. The dashboard contains a bunch of widgets that display various information and functionalities. You can customize the dashboard by adding or removing widgets to suit your needs.

There, you can put widgets that display your calendar, to-do list, weather forecast, or any other information you want to see at a glance, or widgets that provide functionalities like creating a new task or event, and adjust the layout however you like.

Here is an example of my own dashboard layout:

Of course, you won't see the dashboard populated with widgets like mine when you first log in. In fact, it will be empty. You'll need to add widgets to the dashboard yourself.

For detailed guide on how to manage widgets, refer to [The Dashboard Guide](/user-guide/dashboard).

<section id="modules">
## Modules

LifeForge is designed to be modular, meaning you can install different modules to add functionalities to the system. Modules can be anything from a simple utility tool to a complex application. You can install module using a single command in the terminal thanks to the built-in <code>forgeCLI</code> tool.

For more information on how to install and manage modules, refer to [The Modules Guide](/user-guide/modules).

## Personalization

LifeForge is all about personalization. You can customize the system to suit your needs and preferences. You can change the colors, fonts, languages, and many other aspects of the system in the **Personalization** page, which is also accessible from the sidebar.

## API Keys

To manage your API keys, head to the **API Keys** page, which is accessible from the sidebar under the **Settings** section. Here, you can add, edit, and delete API keys for different services. All the API keys you add will be encrypted and stored securely in the database.
