###### Modules

# The Heart of LifeForge

I have always been a big fan of being able to extend the functionality of a system through modules or plugins. With the passion for modularity, LifeForge is built with a module system at its core, allowing developers to create, share, and integrate custom modules seamlessly.

## What are Modules?

Modules in LifeForge are self-contained packages that encapsulate specific functionalities, features, or integrations. They can range from simple utilities to complex systems, and they can be easily added or removed from a LifeForge instance without affecting the core system.

LifeForge provides a robust module API and a set of powerful UI components to facilitate the development and integration of modules. This allows developers to focus on building their modules functionalities without worrying about the underlying infrastructure as well as the UI consistency.

## Discovering Modules

Currently, all official LifeForge modules (those you have seen living inside the monorepo before) are hosted on GitHub under the [LifeForge App](https://github.com/lifeforge-app) organization. Each module will be in its own repository, with the name formatted as <code>lifeforge-module-\<moduleName\></code>. If you want to install the module, the name you will use is simply the <code>\<moduleName\></code> part.

<Note>
In the very near future, there will be an official LifeForge module registry / marketplace website where you can browse and search for modules easily.

## Installing Modules

With the help of the built-in <code>ForgeCLI</code> tool, installing modules is a breeze. You can simply run a command to install a module from the official LifeForge module registry or from a custom source.

<Code language="bash">
{'bun run forge modules add <author>/<moduleName>'}
</Code>

For example, to install a module named <code>ideaBox</code> from the official LifeForge GitHub repository, you would run:
<Code language="bash">
{`bun run forge modules add lifeforge-app/ideaBox`}
</Code>

This command will download the module, install its dependencies and database schema, and register it with your LifeForge instance automatically. Once installed, you can start using the module right away.

<Warning>
Make sure your LifeForge instance is **NOT** running while installing or uninstalling modules to avoid any potential issues.

## Uninstalling Modules

Uninstalling a module is just as easy as installing one. You can use the <code>ForgeCLI</code> tool to remove a module from your LifeForge instance.

<Code language="bash">
{`bun run forge modules remove <moduleName>`}
</Code>

For example, to uninstall the <code>ideaBox</code> module, you would run:
<Code language="bash">
{`bun run forge modules remove ideaBox`}
</Code>

<Note>
Uninstalling a module **WILL NOT** delete any collections or data associated with that module to prevent any unwanted data loss. If you wish to remove the data as well, you will need to do so manually through the Pocketbase admin dashboard.
